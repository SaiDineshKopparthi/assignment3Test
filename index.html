        <h2>My favourite team sport is cricket</h2>
        <p>
            The reason why I like <b>cricket</b> it helps players devlop their <b>social skills</b> such as <b>communication, 
            cooperation and learning how to cope with winning and losing</b>. Playing cricket also include <b>health 
            benefits</b> such as <b>endurance, stamina, physical fitness and improved hand-eye coordination</b>.
